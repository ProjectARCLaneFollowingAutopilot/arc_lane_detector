# ARC-Lane-Detector
**Authors:** [Nikhilesh Alatur](), [Robin Deuber]()

**Current version:** 1.0.0 

The ARC-Lane-Detector package was developed for lane detection in partially structured environments by finding lines in a camera image.

#1. License

#2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 14.04**. 

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.10. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.10**.

## Eigen


## ROS 

## ARC-Lane-Tracking Tools
We developed a library with different tools for running the lane detector algorithm in this repository. The tools include: Inverse Perspective Mapping, Line Detector, RANSAC polynomial fitting. The Lane-Tracking-Tools repository has to be in the same folder as the Lane-Detector Repository.
